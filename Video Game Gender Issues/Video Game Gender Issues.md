## The Challenge

Being a new medium, the video-game industry is providing modern entertainment for all types of people. Like most other tech-based industries, inequality between females and males is problematic. Organizations such as Feminist Frequency have brought attention to the literature of games being male-centered. The criticism was not received well by adult male video-gamers.

As a challenge given through my class at RMCAD, I made the decision to address a few of these issues for women through data visualization.

## Discovery & Research Analysis

A main criticism about Gender Issues in the video-game industry is presented in a way that flags men as the instigators and cause. This would have not been problematic if the research and information was better presented. Most of the research initial involved looking through Feminist Frequency Video Series.  To achieve an objective stance,  information regarding the quantitative data was needed.
